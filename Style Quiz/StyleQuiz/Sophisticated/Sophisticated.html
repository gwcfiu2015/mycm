    <h1> Sophisticated </h1>
  <p> People with sophisticated style are not easily satisfied. Similar to classic, these people want high quality. Aside from high quality, distinction and culture polish which is beyond the elegance are needed. People who appreciate sophisticated style are often socialites or want to be one. In fact, these people dream themselves as connoisseurs who value haute culture and luxury.  </p>
