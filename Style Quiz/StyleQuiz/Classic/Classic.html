    <h1> Classic</h1>
  <p> Classic style may express comfort, but actually it focuses more on quality and popular style such as white button-down blouses, ballet flats, a wide-legged trouser and leather boots. Classic apparel has a superb fabric and impecabble tailoring. It focuses on clean uncluttered lines and formal balance, which expresses a sense of stability. If you have this type of fashion, you are showing simple elegance in your wardrobe. </p>
